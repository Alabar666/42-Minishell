## How to clone the project

This project use a submodule for libft which allows me to update the libft while working at this project.

To clone properly you can use that command:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:MarkosComK/42-Minishell.git
```

## Git-flow

This project has a guide for now that you can check <a href="https://www.notion.so/markoscomk/Minishell-10a7f389561a8071b283f60971d94217">here</a>

I added a rule to protect the main branch so me and my partner can only make commits (which means add code) by sending Pull-requests; the PR must be reviewed from the partner / peer before be added to the main project.

## Binary tree flow

Our approach to organize the user input in order to properly run them as bash does is by using binary-trees
this is also a good oportunity to learn this data structure -- soon this example will be implemented into these
docs.

### Binary tree - image

this example is not 100% clear yet but, as i said, i'm still learning binary trees so keep looking into the repo.
